Challenges
- Building the database schema
- Two things : users and the kitchens
- Displaying views programmatically
- Making sure that the Data are being passed in correctly

To do
- Lots!
- Host resources elsewhere
- use the user's location
- Order
- Update data simultaneously across app
- Encrypty user information
- Build the Firebase schema in an efficient manner. 
It only supports evens listeners for only one level.
So, I have to create unique ids to associate between
the data. Order > ids of items instead of nested data
- Account setting page also needs to work
- UI
